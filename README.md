# Hello 👁️

I did not write this code.
This is the initial version of Panthera website, as I received it and started optimizing it for better SEO and performance, as well as for meeting the [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for accessibility.

I made it available so that you can compare it with [the optimized version of the site](https://voidermalie.github.io/panthera_new) in live, or at the [code level](https://github.com/voidermalie/panthera_new).
